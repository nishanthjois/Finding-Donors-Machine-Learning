# Finding-Donors-Machine-Learning

In this project, we will employ several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. 
We will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. 
Out goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 
This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. 
Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.
